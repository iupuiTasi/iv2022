      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>With the progress of automated driving technologies, self-driving cars are driving safely on highways and freeways in most circumstances. However, the lack of safe and smooth interactions with pedestrians becomes one of the significant obstacles preventing fully autonomous vehicles in city streets. Protections of vulnerable road users like pedestrians are of the highest priority in traffic safety, and crashes with pedestrians will significantly impact the trust and public attitudes towards the new mobility technology. Disruptive interactions with pedestrians may also lower both the riding experiences and driving efficiency in the pedestrian-rich road environments. It is vital to understand pedestrians and make motion planning based on the predictions of their behaviors. </p>

	<p>Besides pedestrian detection and tracking, many research efforts have been put into recognizing pedestrians' behaviors and predicting their trajectories in the past few years. The achievements can predict potential crashes and make motion-planning decisions accordingly in a longer duration. This Workshop will focus on the detection, recognition, and prediction of pedestrian behaviors for automated driving cars to interact with them smoothly. The goal is to build a platform for sharing state-of-the-art models, algorithms, and datasets in the field and identifying research needs and directions.</p>

			<p>Mohan Trivedi received his PhD in Electrical Engineering from Utah State University in 1979, after completing undergraduate work in India. He has published extensively and has edited over a dozen volumes including books, special issues, video presentations, and conference proceedings. Trivedi is a recipient of the Pioneer Award and the Meritorious Service Award from the IEEE Computer Society; and the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Utah State University. He is a Fellow of the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE). He is a founding member of the Executive Committee of the UC System-wide Digital Media Innovation Program (DiMI). Trivedi is also Editor-in-Chief of Machine Vision Applications (http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/journals/00138/index.htm).</p>
