However, the lack of safe and smooth interactions with pedestrians becomes one of the significant obstacles preventing fully autonomous vehicles in city streets. Protections of vulnerable road users like pedestrians are of the highest priority in traffic safety, and crashes with pedestrians will significantly impact the trust and public attitudes towards the new mobility technology. Disruptive interactions with pedestrians may also lower both the riding experiences and driving efficiency in the pedestrian-rich road environments. It is vital to understand pedestrians and make motion planning based on the predictions of their behaviors. <br/> Besides pedestrian detection and tracking, many research efforts have been put into recognizing pedestrians&#x27; behaviors and predicting their trajectories in the past few years. The achievements can predict potential crashes and make motion-planning decisions accordingly in a longer duration. This Workshop will focus on the detection, recognition, and prediction of pedestrian behaviors for automated driving cars to interact with them smoothly. The goal is to build a platform for sharing state-of-the-art models, algorithms, and datasets in the field and identifying research needs and directions.</p></div></div><div class="section-4 wf-section"><h1 id="topics" class="topics">Topics</h1><div class="container-7 w-container"><ul role="list" class="list-10"><li class="list-item-19">Vehicle-pedestrian interaction</li><li class="list-item-18">Pedestrian detection and tracking</li><li class="list-item-20">Pedestrian trajectory prediction</li><li class="list-item-20">Pedestrian intention estimation</li><li class="list-item-20">Pedestrian behavior and action recognition</li><li class="list-item-20">Pedestrian behavior modeling</li><li class="list-item-20">Factors affecting pedestrian behavior and decision-making</li><li class="list-item-20">Vehicle motion and path planning</li><li class="list-item-20">Performance evaluation for pedestrian behavior prediction algorithms</li></ul></div><div class="container-2 w-container"></div></div><section id="feature-section" class="feature-section wf-section"><h1 id="Speakers" class="heading-11">Speakers</h1><h3 class="heading-13">Invited Speaker</h3><div class="flex-container w-container"><div class="feature-image-mask"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/613787b27794b085129f1328/621cefc5710a976e5b68131b_Mohan%20Trivedi.png" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 82vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, 100vw" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/613787b27794b085129f1328/621cefc5710a976e5b68131b_Mohan%20Trivedi-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/613787b27794b085129f1328/621cefc5710a976e5b68131b_Mohan%20Trivedi.png 512w" alt="" class="feature-image"/></div><div><h2 class="heading-9">Mohan Trivedi</h2><h5>University of California – San Diego</h5><a href="https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/node/3464">Website</a><p class="paragraph-7"><strong>Short bio: </strong>Mohan Trivedi received his PhD in Electrical Engineering from Utah State University in 1979, after completing undergraduate work in India.
